# Welcome to the **PACE Lecture Series** Page!

This site serves as the central hub for cataloging all the monthly and lightning talks hosted by members of the **PACE Lab**. Think of it as our shared knowledge repository—organized, accessible, and chaos-free. Here, you'll find records of what we've discussed and who presented.

## 📢 Volunteering for a Talk

Want to volunteer for a talk? Just reach out to me, and I'll add you to the roster. However, "volunteer" might be a slight misnomer—every member is required to present at least **one paper per semester** to ensure the program's success.

Your presentation can take any form: slides, a one-pager, notes from your wiki, Org-mode files, or your handwritten notes. Just come, share, and let's have some academic fun while we discuss and explore!

## 🗓️ Monthly Meets

We meet **twice a month**, every alternate **Wednesday from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM IST**. Wednesdays are often referred to as the "hump day" of the week — perfect for a midweek academic recharge!

If you'd like to showcase a cool tool or software that makes a researcher's life easier, feel free to bring it along. Let's explore and discuss innovations together.

## 📋 Templates and Guidelines

We don't enforce a strict template. Choose a format that you're comfortable with. Once you have the template make sure you have it in a shareable format so that we can catalogue it for future references.  
The only guideline? Make sure the paper you present has made it to a **top conference**.
