#### **Talk 1**
- **Topic:** Does OCaml Dream of High performance FPGAs?

- **Description:** Come with me on a fun adventure with Hardcaml, an embedded domain-specific language (DSL) built in OCaml for designing high-performance FPGA applications. The talk will cover the fundamental design principles behind Hardcaml and provide a framework for creating embedded DSLs for hardware design. We will also examine how FPGAs work, the current state of hardware tooling, and demonstrate how software engineering principles can transform the hardware design process. The talk will also (hopefully) feature practical demonstrations using the Arty A7 FPGA board. All discussed tools and libraries are open-source and available on GitHub along with my experience and tutorials written down in excruciating detail at https://ocamlstreet.gitbook.io/

- **Time:** 4:30 pm to 5:15 pm (IST)
