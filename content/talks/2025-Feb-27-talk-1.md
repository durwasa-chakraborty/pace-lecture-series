#### **Talk 1**
- **Topic:** Concurrent and Parallel programming with OCaml 5

- **Description:** OCaml 5 has brought native support for concurrency and parallelism to OCaml. In this talk, I will present the concurrent and parallel programming primitives exposed by the compiler, and the design decisions that went into making these features backwards compatible for existing users. I will also describe the libraries and tools that we have built to help users take advantage of new features. Finally, if time permits, I will share our experience with porting a large multi-process-parallel application to a shared-memory-multicore one.


- **Time** 5 pm to 6 pm (IST)  
- **Presenter:** Prof.KC Sivaramakrishnan
