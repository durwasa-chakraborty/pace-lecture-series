#### **Talk 1**
- **Topic:** Dynamic MaxFlow in Starplat Cuda Backend

- **Description:** Dynamic MaxFlow in Starplat Cuda Backend: This project involves the design, implementation, and evaluation of a dynamic maximum flow
	algorithm that efficiently handles batch updates to edge capacities. The algorithm is implemented
	using StarPlat, a high-level Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for graph algorithms, which
	generates CUDA code for execution on many-core GPU architectures. The generated code
	significantly reduces recomputation overhead by reusing results from a previously computed
	static flow while being more efficient in terms of both time and memory usage when compared to
	recomputing the maximum flow from scratch after each update.
